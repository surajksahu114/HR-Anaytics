# HR-Analytics

## Project objective:
HR analytics has become increasingly important in modern organizations due to its ability to provide valuable insights into various aspects of human resources management. Analyzing recruitment data helps in identifying the most effective sourcing channels, assessing candidate quality, and improving the recruitment process. Similarly, analyzing turnover data can uncover patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition, allowing organizations to take preventive measures to retain talent.
HR analytics can provide insights into employee performance, identifying top performers, areas for improvement, and factors influencing productivity. This information is valuable for performance evaluations, training programs, and career development initiatives. By analyzing workforce demographics, skills inventory, and performance data, HR analytics helps organizations forecast future workforce needs and plan accordingly. This includes identifying skill gaps, succession planning, and workforce restructuring.
## Problems Addressed:
1.	Attrition VS Education Level
2.	Attrition VS Age Group
3.	Job Satisfaction VS Job Role
4.	Attrition VS Monthly Salary
5.	Attrition Variation By Years Spent By Employees

## Results:
1. Employees who belong to Life Sciences and medical Streams are more likely to leave the company in future.
2. Employees from the age range 26-35 are more prone to attrite the organization compared to other age group. A possible reason might include their exploratory nature to learn more skills.
3. Maximum employee who attritioned from the organization belong to laboratory technician and Sales Executive.

5. Attrition number was high at first and ten years of time spent at company.
6. Maximum number of employees leave the organization after spending a year in corresponding job role.

## Future Recommendations:
### 1.	Retention Programs: 
Implement retention programs specifically targeted at employees who have completed one year in their job roles. This could include mentorship programs, career development opportunities, and regular check-ins to ensure their needs are being met.
### 2.	Long-Term Engagement Strategies: 
Develop strategies to increase engagement and satisfaction among employees who have been with the company for ten years or more. This could involve offering new challenges, opportunities for advancement, or revisiting compensation and benefits packages.
### 3.	Salary Adjustments: 
Conduct a thorough review of salaries, particularly for employees earning less than $5,000 per month. Ensure that compensation is competitive within the industry to reduce the likelihood of employees leaving for better-paying positions elsewhere.
### 4.	Focus on Key Roles: 
Pay special attention to roles with high attrition rates, such as laboratory technicians and sales executives. Investigate the reasons behind the attrition and implement measures to address any underlying issues, such as workload, career progression, or workplace culture
### 5.	Development Opportunities for Mid-Career Employees: 
Recognize the propensity for attrition among employees aged 26-35 who may be seeking new challenges and skills development. Provide opportunities for continuous learning, career advancement, and skill enhancement to keep them engaged and motivated.
### 6.	Retention Strategies for Life Sciences and Medical Streams: 
Given the likelihood of attrition among employees in life sciences and medical streams, tailor retention strategies specifically for these departments. This could involve offering specialized training, career paths, or benefits that cater to the unique needs and interests of employees in these fields.

By addressing these areas, stakeholders can proactively mitigate attrition and foster a more stable and engaged workforce for the future.
